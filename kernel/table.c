/* The object file of "table.c" contains most kernel data. Variables that 
 * are declared in the *.h files appear with EXTERN in front of them, as in
 *
 *    EXTERN int x;
 *
 * Normally EXTERN is defined as extern, so when they are included in another
 * file, no storage is allocated.  If EXTERN were not present, but just say,
 *
 *    int x;
 *
 * then including this file in several source files would cause 'x' to be
 * declared several times.  While some linkers accept this, others do not,
 * so they are declared extern when included normally.  However, it must be
 * declared for real somewhere.  That is done here, by redefining EXTERN as
 * the null string, so that inclusion of all *.h files in table.c actually
 * generates storage for them.  
 *
 * Various variables could not be declared EXTERN, but are declared PUBLIC
 * or PRIVATE. The reason for this is that extern variables cannot have a  
 * default initialization. If such variables are shared, they must also be
 * declared in one of the *.h files without the initialization.  Examples 
 * include 'tasktab' (this file) and 'idt'/'gdt' (protect.c). 
 *
 * Changes:
 *    Nov 10, 2004   removed controller->driver mappings  (Jorrit N. Herder)
 *    Oct 17, 2004   updated above and tasktab comments  (Jorrit N. Herder)
 *    May 01, 2004   included p_sendmask in tasktab  (Jorrit N. Herder)
