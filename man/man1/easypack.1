.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A package in .tar.bz2 format is fetched from \fIwww.minix3.org\fR,
copied to \fI/usr/src/commands\fR, decompressed and untarred.
Then the \fIbuild\fR script in the top-level directory is executed
to install it. This command should be called when logged in as bin
to provide write access to the relevant directories. A log file,
\fILog\fR is produced for debugging in case building fails.
