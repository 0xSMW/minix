
Welcome to MINIX 3. This CD-ROM is a live CD. You can boot your computer
from it and MINIX 3 will start automatically without using the hard
disk.  At the prompt, login as root. It works pretty much like any UNIX
system in command line mode. You can have up to four virtual terminals
open at once.

Nevertheless, to do anything besides demonstrating MINIX 3, you need to
install the system to your hard disk.

This CD-ROM contains the following files visible from Windows or Linux:

   - README.TXT      This file
   - SETUP.PS:       setup guide in PostScript
   - SETUP.PDF:      setup guide in PDF (requires Adobe Acrobat reader)
   - PRESZ134.ZIP    Windows utility to resize FAT partitions
   - BOOTFLOP.IMG    If you cannot boot from CD-ROMs, insert the CD-ROM
                     anyway, then copy this floppy image raw to a floppy using
                     RawWrite (ask Google) and boot from the floppy
   - LISTING.TXT     Appendix B as ASCII text
   - LISTING.PS	     Appendix B in PostScript
   - LISTING.PDF     Appendix B in PDF
   - INDEX.TXT	     Index of files

There are also many invisible files used for installing MINIX 3.


To install MINIX 3, please print either the PostScript or PDF setup
manual or get it from www.minix3.org/doc/ under the heading Installation.
You will need to carry out several steps before beginning the installation,
as described in the setup guide and having it available during installation
will be useful since the on-screen directions are quite concise.

The official MINIX 3 Website is www.minix3.org. It has a wealth of
information about MINIX 3 and more recent versions of the software as
well as additional software not on this CD-ROM. It alnewsgroup,
comp.os.minix, where you can ask questions and get help. In addition, it
tells how you can run MINIX 3 on a simulator on top of Windows or Linux
instead of on the bare metal. You can also join the MINIX 3 community,
report bugs, and help push MINIX 3 forward by porting applications and
drivers to it. We encourage you to visit!


We hope you enjoy using MINIX 3.
