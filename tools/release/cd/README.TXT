
Welcome to MINIX 3 !

This CD is intended to be booted. It contains a MINIX system that you
can run (a so-called "Live CD"). You can also install MINIX to your
harddisk with it. It's contents aren't visible here.

In this directory:
	.  README.TXT - thisfile
	.  PRESZ134.ZIP - a utility to resize your current partition.
	   This may be convenient to make space for MINIX.
	.  MINIXSRC.TGZ - an archive all minix sources.
	   It's a gzip-compressed .tar file. E.g. WinZip can read it.
