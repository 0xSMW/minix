
Welcome to MINIX 3 !

This CD is intended to be booted. It contains a MINIX system that you
can run (a so-called "Live CD"). You can also install MINIX to your
harddisk with it. Its contents are not visible here.

In this directory:
	README.TXT: This file.
	PRESZ134.ZIP: A tool to help resizing partitions.
	BOOTFLP.IMG: If you can't boot from CD, write this image to a
	             floppy and boot from it, while having the CD in a
	             CD drive. The system on the floppy should find the
	             CD and start up as if it had been booted from CD.
